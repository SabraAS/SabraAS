### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- I'm a software developer at a startup in Brazil, CyberLabs Ai.

- :computer: Currently working on an app, called KeyApp. KeyApp is an access application that uses the state of the art in facial recognition, making physical contact unnecessary. Check the website https://keyapp.ai/ if u want to know more about it (this is a CyberLabs Ai product, I work on the developer's team that make the app)

- Also, i'm learning alot about nativescript-vue, making native apps in <b>hard</b> dude.

- :coffee: If u want to talk about Coffee, u came to the right person.

- Something about me: I like to read unknown books, we can discover great writers on the internet. Actually, I like to read any books, any kind.

Ps: i work with vue.js, nativescript-vue, sass and pug

Ps2: CSS :black_heart:
